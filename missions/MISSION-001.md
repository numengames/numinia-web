## 📝 Subtitle

The public gallery that replaces numinia.store's Layer 0: one SSG URL per
asset, multi-format viewing, search, downloads — fully local until push day.

## 📖 Story Statement

As a visitor, I want to browse, preview and download CC0 digital goods in my
language, so that Numinia's material culture is useful to me even before I know
the city exists.

## ⚡ Pragmatic Value

Funnel 1 (visitor → downloader) becomes real: every card, filter and download
is instrumented. v0.17.0 material.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin — features/archive.feature)

- Every public, non-draft asset from the validated catalogs gets a page in all
  five locales, each with `<html lang>`, SEO title/description and OG tags.
- The archive index lists every public asset with name, format and category;
  empty catalogs render a localized empty state.
- Search and format filters narrow the grid client-side (verified in Playwright).
- Each detail page offers the right preview for its format (image/audio/video
  native; GLB+VRM via the 3D island; HYP shows metadata + download only) and a
  download link resolved through the domain storage chain.
- Every interactive element carries `data-metric`; downloads carry
  `archive-download`.
- WCAG A/AA gate passes on the archive index and detail pages; bundle budgets hold.
- Hermetic build: `DATA_SOURCE=fixture` renders the full archive from the
  committed multi-catalog snapshot.

## 🚫 Out of scope

Wallet/auth, LAP, seasons, character sheet, HYP deep parsing, server-side
search, data-repo writes, deploy.

## ⚠️ Risks

| Risk                               | Mitigation                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Dead URLs found by data-doctor (4) | Pages render with placeholder + report link; missing binary asset still gets a page but download shows unavailable state |
| 3dprint catalog 404                | Excluded from sources; recorded in data-doctor report                                                                    |
